## Linux Kernel Layer

![android-stack_2x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a512b24a-3a10-4910-96ef-28d56810bef4)

- **Role**: Forms the foundational layer of Android, providing core system services such as memory, power management, and process management.
- **Components**:
  - **Memory Management**: Allocates and manages memory for processes and apps.
  - **Process Management**: Manages and schedules processes across the CPU.
  - **Drivers**:
    - **Display Driver**: Manages the display hardware and rendering processes.
    - **Camera Driver**: Provides low-level control over camera hardware.
    - **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Drivers**: Manages wireless communication interfaces.
  - **Security**: Integrates Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) for enforcing access control policies, ensuring app isolation and protecting against malware.
- **Purpose**: The kernel provides the core system infrastructure, allowing Android to manage resources, hardware, and security in an efficient and stable manner.

## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

![android-stack_hal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00c81bf9-b96d-4b0b-8a1f-fb1d5a158476)

- **Role**: Acts as a mediator between Android’s higher-level system services and hardware-specific code.
- **Components**:
  - **Binderized HALs**: Use Android’s Binder Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to manage hardware resources, ideal for recent hardware.
  - **Passthrough HALs**: Directly link hardware libraries to the Android framework, commonly used for legacy components.
  - **Common HAL Modules**:
    - **Camera HAL**: Controls device cameras and supports high-performance camera features.
    - **Audio HAL**: Manages audio playback and recording through speakers, microphones, and Bluetooth.
    - **Sensors HAL**: Interfaces with motion, orientation, and other device sensors.
- **Purpose**: The HAL ensures Android can interact with hardware components consistently, even if vendors implement these components differently.

## Android Runtime (ART)

![android-stack_art](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba1286b2-3bfb-4c15-afad-8e8f8a7c05a1)

- **Role**: Executes Android applications and optimizes their performance.
- **Components**:
  - **ART (Android Runtime)**:
    - **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation**: Compiles app code into native machine code during installation, improving performance and reducing memory usage.
    - **Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation**: Dynamically compiles code at runtime, allowing for code optimization based on usage patterns.
  - **Zygote**:
    - Acts as the parent process for all Android applications.
    - Preloads core classes and resources, enabling fast app startup by sharing memory across app processes.
- **Purpose**: ART provides a balance between high performance and efficient memory usage, allowing Android apps to run smoothly on mobile devices with limited resources.

## Native Libraries and C/C++ Libraries

![android-stack_native](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4518d2da-51c8-4ece-bfd1-35b835fd78e6)

- **Role**: Provide essential functionalities to the Android OS, supporting core features and apps.
- **Components**:
  - **Core Libraries**:
    - **libc (Bionic)**: The main C library for Android, optimized for mobile environments.
    - **libm**: Supports mathematical operations, enabling app functions that require complex calculations.
  - **Media Libraries**:
    - **OpenMAX AL**: Manages multimedia codecs for audio and video processing.
    - **MediaPlayer**: Supports high-performance video playback and audio streaming.
  - **Graphics Libraries**:
    - **OpenGL ES**: Provides a graphics API for 2D and 3D rendering in games and visual applications.
    - **Skia Graphics Engine**: Handles rendering for the UI, enabling smooth visuals in apps.
  - **Security Libraries**:
    - **OpenSSL**: Provides cryptographic functions for secure communications.
    - **libcrypt**: Supports hashing and encryption, ensuring data protection.
  - **Database Libraries**:
    - **SQLite**: The default database engine used by Android apps for local storage.
- **Purpose**: These libraries support Android’s multimedia, security, graphics, and database functionalities, offering high-performance capabilities required by mobile applications.

## Android Framework

![android-stack_api](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce5be2f1-f26a-4e72-987f-93ef0702f42a)

- **Role**: Provides a collection of Java APIs for developers to interact with core Android components and services.
- **Components**:
  - **Activity Manager**: Manages the lifecycle of apps and coordinates transitions between activities.
  - **Content Providers**: Enables data sharing between applications, allowing access to structured data like contacts.
  - **Resource Manager**: Manages external resources such as strings, layouts, and drawable assets.
  - **Notification Manager**: Supports notifications to alert users to background activities.
  - **Location Manager**: Provides access to device location, supporting GPS, Wi-Fi, and network-based location.
  - **View System**: Manages the interface components, allowing apps to display UI elements such as buttons and text fields.
- **Purpose**: The framework simplifies development by providing reusable components and managing common tasks like data sharing, notifications, and user interaction.
